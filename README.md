# Idea for plugs.

Cable management can be really exhausting, especially if you're face down under your desk trying to find cable plugs, that are connected to gear in another room. Thats where the idea for plugs. came from. Before you have to touch each cable to know where it leads, just open plugs. and let it tell you, where your favourite synthesizers output is connected to.
